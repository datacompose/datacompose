## What is Datacompose?

Datacompose is a framework that helps you create reusable data cleaning functions (UDFs) that work across different data platforms. Instead of writing the same cleaning logic multiple times for different systems, you define it once in YAML and generate platform-specific implementations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip or conda for package management
- (Optional) Docker for containerized development

## Next Steps

1. [Install Datacompose](installation.md)
2. Follow the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md)
3. [Create your first UDF](first-udf.md)
